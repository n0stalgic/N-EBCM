# N-EBCM
A hobby EBCM-ish project designed to run on an Infineon AURIX TC375 Shieldbuddy. Does ABS on a single wheel brake rig test setup (for now).

Cores 0 and 1 will run the ABS algorithm as well as other diagnostics, and Core 2 will control the PWM outputs to the motor driving the wheel.

TODO: Add hardware specs here
