# N-EBCM
A hobby EBCM-ish project designed to run on an Infineon AURIX TC375 Lite Kit. Does ABS on a single wheel brake rig test setup (for now).

Core 0 will run the ABS algorithm and actuate the braks, core 1 will handle the motor control, and core 2 will handle debug output and non-critical I/O

I'll add other hardware details as they are defined
